# ColourSightedX

A BetterDiscord plugin to revert the colourblind status icons back to their original circular selves. Inspired by the [original ColourSighted plugin](https://github.com/Mega-Mewthree/BetterDiscordPlugins/blob/master/Plugins/ColorSighted/ColorSighted.plugin.js).

## How to Install

Download the `ColourSightedX.plugin.js` file and place it into your BetterDiscord plugins folder. Afterwards, turn the plugin on, and you should no longer see colourblind status icons. (except for some places but I can't really do much about that without using lots of CPU usage, if any better coders (anyone) want to take a shot at it please be my guest)
