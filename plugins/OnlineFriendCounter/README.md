# OnlineFriendCounter

A BetterDiscord plugin to restore the old online label that was removed in mid-2019, specifying how many of your friends are online. Has the added benefit of updating in real-time as well.

## Requirements

This plugin requires [ZeresPluginLibrary](https://github.com/rauenzi/BDPluginLibrary) in order to work, so make sure that is installed first. If not, the plugin will prompt you to download it as well.

## How to Install

Download the `OnlineFriendCounter.plugin.js` file and place it into your BetterDiscord plugins folder. Afterwards, turn the plugin on, and you should now see how many of your friends are online under the home button.
