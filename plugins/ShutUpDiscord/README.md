## Requirements

This plugin requires [ZeresPluginLibrary](https://github.com/rauenzi/BDPluginLibrary) in order to work, so make sure that is installed first. If not, the plugin will prompt you to download it as well.

## How to Install

Download the `ShutUpDiscord.plugin.js` file and place it into your BetterDiscord plugins folder. Afterwards, turn the plugin on, and use the settings menu to customize what you wish to hide. By default, it hides avatar decorations, the 'Wave to say hi!' button, and the in-voice emoji reactions.
