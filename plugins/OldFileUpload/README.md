# OldFileUpload

A BetterDiscord plugin to revert the (+) button's functionality to just file uploads, like it used to be before it was changed in 2021. If you're like me and don't give a shit about the other menu options, this is for you!

## Requirements

This plugin requires [ZeresPluginLibrary](https://github.com/rauenzi/BDPluginLibrary) in order to work, so make sure that is installed first. If not, the plugin will prompt you to download it as well.

## How to Install

Download the `OldFileUpload.plugin.js` file and place it into your BetterDiscord plugins folder. Afterwards, turn the plugin on, and you should have a simplified plus button.
