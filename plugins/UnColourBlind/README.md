# UnColourBlind

A BetterDiscord plugin to revert the colourblind status icons back to their original circular selves. The [ColourSighted plugin](https://github.com/Mega-Mewthree/BetterDiscordPlugins/blob/master/Plugins/ColorSighted/ColorSighted.plugin.js) doesn't seem to work anymore, which inspired me to make this plugin. A theme version is also available.

## Requirements

This plugin doesn't rely on any libraries, so you can just run it as is!

## How to Install

Download the `UnColourBlind.plugin.js` file and place it into your BetterDiscord plugins folder. Afterwards, turn the plugin on, and you should no longer see colourblind status icons.  
  
If you wish to use the theme version instead, download the `UnColourBlind.theme.css` file and place it into your BetterDiscord themes folder.  

If you're using Vencord, go to `Settings > Themes > Online Themes`, and then paste the raw css link into the text box.
